Change Log: 

	- (5/06/2021) Way too many comments making readability of code generally poor. Lowering number of comments and using more meaningful naming conventions  
	- (5/06/2021) In the process of adding simple GUI, allowing user to input desired twitter username and carry out a few simple operations regarding said username
What I'm learning:
	
	- Python GUI using TKINTER (simpledialog module, inherting from frame class, Buttons, Prompts, Storing user input)
	- Tweepy Module(Cool module that makes interacting with Official Twitter API simple.)
	- Twitter Api (utilizing tweepy module for authentication, api module to carry out operations, methods such as user_timeline())
	- General Python Programming (Classes, List, Inheritance, Importing dependencies, try catch exception handling, dunder methods)
